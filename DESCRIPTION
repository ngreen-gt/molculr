Description: This package builds around an optimized C++ algorithm for
    calculating molecular formulae using moiety-based method.  Peak annotation jj jjj j
    is non-deterministic, therefore, a heuristic algorithm has proposed for
    this task.  In development, are more advanced visualization, models and
    tools for working with multiple spectra.
